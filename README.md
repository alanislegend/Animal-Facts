# Animal-Facts
A c++ program that provides animal facts, as well as allows the user to enter their own

To use this program, open the executable and a command prompt should appear
It will ask you what animal you want to learn a random fact about
Once you enter the number of the animal you want to learn about, it will display a random fact
if you type 5 instead of an animal choice, you will be able to choose which animal you want to create a fact about
this will create a file in the same folder that animal-facts.exe is located, allowing you to save and use custom facts in the program later.


I Hope you enjoyed my program!
